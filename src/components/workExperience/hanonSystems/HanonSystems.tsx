              Hanon Systems is a global maufacturer of automotive thermal
              solutions. I was under R&D HVAC Fluid Transport, developing
              prototype HVAC lines for customers such as Ford, General Motors
              and Lucid.

              Hanon, in last 3 years, has seen a significant shift in customer
              focus from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles
              (EV) architecture. This required rapid adptation to new
              technologies and urgent development, including expedited client
              and prototyping timelines and familiarization with new techniques.
              Under historically high workloads, I completed 342 prototype
              requirements of varying complexity over my year at Hanon.
